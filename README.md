# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Dashboard
The project consists of the creation of a dashboard to analyze employee attrition in a company. For this purpose, the extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) process were performed using the Power BI tool. The extraction was performed from a .csv file. The cleaning and transformation of the data was carried out using the Power Query editor and some DAX functions, in order to ensure the quality of the information. Finally, the data was loaded and visualized in a dashboard to identify attrition patterns and possible factors contributing to employee attrition.
